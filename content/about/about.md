# Hi there!

My name is Sean Williams, and I'm currently studying computer engineering as an undergraduate at Columbia University in the City of New York. I'm interested in many aspects of computers spanning from hardware to software, and I love to code in low-level and embedded environments. I hope to continue to pursue academia in the realm of computer engineering and computer science, and contribute to research that can directly better our society and people's everyday lives. In my spare time, I like to play games, play music, tinker with my computing devices, and explore new places. There's not much to see here yet, but feel free to reach out or check out my other socials, my resume, or my blog posts at the links on the left. Thanks for visiting!
